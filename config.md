`*1` See API Documentation for reference (https://aihorde.net/api)  
`*2` Available Samplers: k_lms, k_heun, k_euler, k_euler_a, k_dpm_2, k_dpm_2_a, DDIM, PLMS, k_dpm_fast, k_dpm_adaptive, k_dpmpp_2s_a, k_dpmpp_2m, dpmsolver  
`*3` Not all models are available at all times *1  
`*4` Developer mode will enable logging and will also show the generations ID in the embed in Discord  
`*5` This option changes how the command is created. If set to false the user will not have the option to modify this value when generating or the input they can give is limited.  
`*6` This option must be set to false, leaving it blank will default it to true  
`*7` EXPERIMENTAL OPTION, ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK  
`*8` For example (((test))) will be automatically converted to (test:1.3)  
`*9` Uses an encryption key only known to you to encrypt the users tokens. This is recommended to increase security. Enabling this option may have an impact on speed.  
`*10` Must follow the scheme of https://github.com/db0/Stable-Horde-Styles/blob/main/styles.json  
`*11` Must follow the scheme of https://github.com/db0/Stable-Horde-Styles/blob/main/categories.json
